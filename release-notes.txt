BISDN Linux
v4.1.0 Release Notes
Date: 2020-09-20

! New in this release
- The port LEDs on platform Celestica Questone 2A are now functional.

! Changed behaviour
- Due to FRR 8.0.1 now enforcing link IPv6 local addresses for various
  IPv6 based protocols, IPv6 Link local addresses are now enabled by
  default on all interfaces.
- SSH connections to the switch on non management ports will now also be
  blocked by default for IPv6.

! Bug fixes
- Fixed a longstanding issue where the switch stopped forwarding
  multicast and broadcast packets, breaking protocols like DHCP.
- Fixed a socket leak in baseboxd, which could lead to various issues
  after several days of uptime.
- Fixed multiple issues in multicast handling in baseboxd.
- Fixed a race on handling disappearing nexthops for routes that could
  lead to routing loops when they reappeared.
